# This is a React App and currently an ongoing project

I am building a web app that will firstly solve a problem that I have personally. Of tracking my Stock watchlist, and storing notes on these positions. I am looking to firstly just integrate the note taking and watchlist functionality first, and I will look at how I can grow it further after that. 


## Technologies: 
- React 
- MongoDB
